# Exercise 15: Write a small snippet that does the following:
#    1. Imports the math module.
#    2. Uses math.factorial to compute the factorial of 5 and prints the result.
#    3. Imports the random module (with alias r) and uses it to print a random floating-point number between 0 and 1 
# (hint: random.random() gives a float in [0.0, 1.0)).

import math


print('5! : ', math.factorial(5))

import random
print('Random number: ', random.random())
