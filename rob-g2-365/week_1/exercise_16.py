# Exercise 16: Evaluate the following expressions and write down the result (and type, if relevant) that each produces:
#    1. 5 + 2 * 3
#    = 11
#    2. 5 + 2 * 3 == 11
#    = True 
#    3. 8 / 3
#    = 2.66666
#
#    4. 8 // 3
#    = 2
#
#    5. 8 % 3
#    =2
#
#    6. 2 ** 3 ** 2 (hint: exponentiation is right-associative, so think of this as 2 ** (3 ** 2))
#    512
#    
#    7. "Hello " + "World!"
#    = "Hello World!"
#
#    8. "5" + "6"
#    = "56"
#
#    9. "5" + 6 (what happens here?)
#   Error message
