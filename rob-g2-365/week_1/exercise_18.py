#Exercise 18: For each scenario below, decide if it is more naturally suited for a functional approach 
# or an object-oriented approach (or possibly both):
#    1. You have a list of numbers and you want to produce a new list with each number doubled.
#    I would use a list comprehension.  new_list = [x * 2 for x in orig_list]
#    I guess this is functional
# 
#    2. You are creating a simulation of a library system with books, library members, and loans of books to members.
#    Probably and object oriented approach using classes.  You could also use a proceedural approach using a dictonary.
