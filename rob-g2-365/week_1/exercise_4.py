#Exercise 4: The following variables are given:
#length_str = "15"
#width_str = "8.4"
# They represent the length and width of a rectangle as strings. Convert these to appropriate numeric types 
# (int or float) and calculate the area of the rectangle. Store the area in a variable area and print it.
# Hint: You might need to use both int() and float() depending on the data.

length_str = "15"
width_str = "8.4"

length = int(length_str)
width = float(width_str)

print("length: ", length)
print("width: ", width)
